Ivy is a static website generator built in Python. It's small, elegant, and simple to use.

    $ ivy --help

    Usage: ivy [command]

      Ivy is a static website generator. It transforms a
      directory of text files into a self-contained website.

    Flags:
      -h, --help        Print the application's help text.
      -v, --version     Print the application's version.

    Commands:
      build             Build the site.
      clear             Clear the output directory.
      init              Initialize a new site directory.
      serve             Run the test server.
      tree              Print the site's node tree.
      watch             Monitor the site directory and
                        automatically rebuild on changes.

    Command Help:
      help <command>    Print the command's help text.

You can build many different kinds of website using Ivy but it's particularly suited to building project documentation like the documentation you're looking at right now.



### Formats

Ivy has builtin support for content written in [Markdown][], [Syntext][], or plain HTML, but Ivy itself is format-agnostic --- you can write your content in any format with a suitable Python library.

Similarly, Ivy has builtin support for [Jinja][] and [Ibis][] templates but can use any template language with a suitable Python library.



### Installation

Install Ivy from the Python Package Index using `pip`:

    $ pip install ivy

Ivy requires Python 3.8 or later.

### Plugins

* [Holly](http://www.dmulholl.com/dev/holly.html) --- this blog-engine plugin turns Ivy into a WordPress-style blog generator with support for post and tag indexes.



### Contributing

My goal is to keep Ivy as small and simple as possible so I almost certainly won't accept
pull requests. Ivy's plugin system makes it *extremely* flexible, however, so there's a
good chance any feature you want to add can be written as an extension.  (Let me know if you find
you need an extra event or filter hook to make an extension work.)
